# .reviewboardrc, A local configuration file for ReviewBoard
#
# If you'll always use the same P4 depots and reviewboard servers,
# you can place this in your home directory as .reviewboardrc
# Or, if needed, place unique instances in the roots of your p4 workspaces.
#
# Note, this is parsed as a python script, so use "b = c", NOT "b=c"
# and all the other Pythonic whitespacery :(

# At a minimum, in your own instance you'll want to change the values for:
#   TARGET_PEOPLE and P4_CLIENT,
# and may also need to adjust various login settings depending upon whether
# you have setup P4 environment vars already.
#   TARGET_GROUPS may be useful instead of TARGET_PEOPLE, but depends on the
#  reviewboard server being configured with correct groups.

# BUG! post-review "prefers" git over P4, and it identifies git usage by
# checking for a .git folder in the root of your workspace. If you use
# git locally in your workflow, post-review against a P4 depot WILL FAIL,
# unless you rename or otherwise hide your .git folder, e.g. to "dotgit",
# when submitting to ReviewBoard. I (tarynv) have searched for a way to
# make reviewboard ignore the .git folder and just use P4. Short of hacking
# the python code, there doesn't seem to be a way.

# Load environment vars for os.environ references.
